# pole-coordinates

This is a *preliminary* library to allow transformations
to/from GPS measurements to the South Pole grid coordinate
system. This transformation is time-dependent since the
ice sheet moves ~10 m/year, and the South Pole grid moves
with the ice.

Use at your own risk! Significant checks still need to be
performed as of 2024.
